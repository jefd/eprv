        <p>

          The Extreme Precision Radial Velocity Research Coordination Network
          (EPRV RCN) is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive
          environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. We
          do not tolerate discrimination, harassment or bullying based on
          characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity
          and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
          body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin,
          pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information,
          religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national
          minority, age, education, socio-economic status, and experience
          level.

        </p>

          <h2>Please follow these guidelines</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>
                Behave professionally. Harassment, bullying and sexist, racist,
                or exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate.
                Harassment and bullying include sustained disruption of talks
                or other events, inappropriate physical contact, sexual
                attention or innuendo, deliberate intimidation, stalking, and
                photography or recording of an individual without consent. It
                also includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual
                orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race
                or religion.
              </li>
              <li>
                All communication should be appropriate for a professional
                audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual
                language and imagery are not appropriate.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees.
                Critique ideas, not people.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be respectful of the intellectual property of others.
              </li>
              <li>
                If members wish to share photos or contents of un-published
                research talks and/or presentations belonging to other members,
                they must first get permission from the author.
              </li>
          </ul>

          <p>

          This Code of Conduct applies to all EPRV RCN discussions or
          collaborations on any platform, either online or in-person. Anyone
          who wishes to report a violation of our values or guidelines is asked
          to contact a <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/NNExplore/EPRV-RCN/EPRV-RCN-organizers/">member of the EPRV RCN Steering Committee for review and
            investigation by the Committee.</a>

          </p>
          <p>
            Communications will be held in confidence where possible.
          </p>
          <p>
          The Committee will normally give accused individuals an opportunity to respond to allegations.
          </p>
